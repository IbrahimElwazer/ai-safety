							<b><h3>What is Computer Vision?</h3></b>
							<p>Plainly speaking, Computer Vision falls under the broader and larger field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and is currently one of the fastest growing and most focus-centered subfields of AI. A simple and easy way to define computer vision would be the ability for a computer to see, in the same sense in which we humans can see. But the action of “seeing” is not as simple as it may sound. To see something does not just mean to sight a scene or an image in front of you, but rather it deals with understanding what’s happening in the image in front of you, as to make sense of the context of the image or video. Take the image below as an example:  </p>
							<img src="images/milk-pouring.jpg" alt="" />
							<p>By just quickly glimpsing at the image, you have immediately noticed the essential parts of the overall image, such as a person (you recognized their gender as well), a milk can and a cup. Your eyes, along with your brain, managed to see and process all these parts in a single image with a blink of an eye, without any effort or hard work required from you. More deeply, you also understand what is happening in the image. You can interpret from the image that a man (knowing from the shirt and arms that it’s a male and not a female) is holding a can of milk and is pouring it into a cup. This was easy for you to understand because you have seen such a scene many times before, from your own personal experience of pouring milk into a cup or even just having seen someone do it in front of you, therefore this scene is familiar to you and you were able to easily understand what is happening in the image (the context of the image).</p>
							<p>Although this seems easy and effortlessly to you, it remains a very hard and complex task to make a computer understand the image the same way you just did, and at the same speed. It is much more difficult to the computer than you think, because the computer sees this image as nothing more than just an array of numbers (which represent the pixels that make up the image). This is how the computer sees the above image when you feed it to the program as an input:</p>
							<img src="images/pixels.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300"/>
							<p>You can clearly understand now why it is such a difficult task for the computer to understand and make sense of the image, as it only “sees” the image a huge list of numbers. This is the issue that Computer Vision is solving and thanks to the many decades of research in this subfield of Artificial Intelligence, beginning particularly in the 1960’s, computer scientists and engineers managed to come up with a rule of algorithms that help the computer “see” the image and even understand it, by extracting the meaning or context from the image in the exact same way in which we humans do. </p>
